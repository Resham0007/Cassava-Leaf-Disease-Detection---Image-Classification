# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Detection---Image-Classification
Welcome to the Cassava Leaf Disease Detection project! This repository provides a comprehensive guide to classifying cassava leaf diseases using deep learning techniques with PyTorch.

# Cassava Leaf Disease Detection - Image Classification

# Project Information

The objective is to distinguish between several diseases that cause material harm to the food supply of many African countries. In some cases the main remedy is to burn the infected plants to prevent further spread, which can make a rapid automated turnaround quite useful to the farmers.

[train/test]_images the image files. The full set of test images will only be available to your notebook when it is submitted for scoring. Expect to see roughly 15,000 images in the test set.

### Attributes

image_id -  image file name.

label - ID code for the disease.

label_num_to_disease_map.json - The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.
